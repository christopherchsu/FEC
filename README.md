## Description

> This project is a foray into real development work - building key components of a complex whole and integrating those with the rest of the system. You will be exposed to new technical and project management challenges alongside shifting team dynamics and fewer clear-cut answers. Our objective is to deliver a fully functional web application that meets the specifications and requirements outlined by project stakeholders. Work together on a single code base by dividing up the work among team members but working collaboratively to produce a single front end application. Integrate your front end with the existing API for the product, and demonstrate your working application at the end of the project timeline.
